   * Gets the root folder path of this VFS connection.
   * <p>
   * The root folder path allows limiting the files exposed through a PVFS URL.
   * <p>
   * The default interface implementation exists to ensure backward compatibility and returns {@code null}.
   * <h3>
   * Semantics of the Root Folder Path
   * </h3>
   * Assume a connection without a configured root folder path, <code>connection-name</code>.
   * The general structure of a PVFS URL that resolves to a file in this connection is
   * <code>pvfs://(connection-name)/(rest-path)</code>.
   * If the <code>rest-path</code> component is split in two parts, the root path and the remainder,
   * the following form is achieved: <code>pvfs://(connection-name)/(root-path)/(rest-rest-path)</code>.
   * <p>
   * Assume a connection configured with the root folder path <code>root-path</code>, all other configurations equal,
   * named <code>connection-with-root-path</code>.
   * The same file would be exposed by a <code>pvfs</code> URL in which the <code>root-path</code> component is omitted:
   * <code>pvfs://(connection-with-root-path)/(rest-rest-path)</code>.
   * <p>
   * Necessarily, the configured root path must identify a file of type folder.
   * <p>
   * Files which are not descendant of a connection's root folder path cannot be identified/accessed using a
   * <code>pvfs</code> URL. Folder segments of a <code>pvfs</code> URL cannot have the special names <code>.</code> or
   * <code>..</code>.
   * <h3>
   * Syntax of the Root Folder Path
   * </h3>
   * The syntax of the root folder path is that of one or more folder names separated by a folder separator,
   * <code>/</code>. For example, the following would be syntactically valid: <code>my-vfs-bucket/my-folder</code>.
   * While a leading or a trailing folder separator should be tolerated, a <i>normalized</i> root folder path
   * should have none.
   * <p>
   * The value stored in this property is subject to variable substitution and thus may not conform to the syntax
   * of a root folder path. The syntax is validated only after variable substitution is performed.
   * <h3>
   * Impact of Root Folder Path on Provider URLs
   * </h3>
   * While omitted from the <code>pvfs</code> URL, the root folder path is incorporated in the <i>provider-specific</i>
   * (a.k.a. internal) URL, as a result of the conversion process from <code>pvfs</code> to <code>provider</code> URL.
   * The root folder path is not a required component of provider URLs, and files which are not descendants of the root
   * folder path are still resolvable. The root folder path is not a security feature, by itself.
   * <p>
   * The general structure of a provider URL corresponding to the above <code>pvfs</code> URL is like:
   * <code>(scheme):// [(domain) /] [(root-path) /] [(rest-rest-path)]</code>
   * <p>
   * Where the <i>scheme</i> component is given by the {@link #getType()} property, and the <i>domain</i> component is
   * given by the {@link #getDomain()} property.
   * <p>
   * The provider URL structure for specific providers may vary from this general structure. However, the semantics of
   * the root folder path property should be respected.
   * <h3>
   * Examples of <code>pvfs</code> and Provider URLs
   * </h3>
   * Given an S3 connection, with a configured root folder path of <code>my-bucket/my-folder</code>,
   * the <code>pvfs</code> URL, <code>pvfs://my-s3-connection/my-sub-folder/my-file</code>, would convert to the
   * provider URL, <code>s3://my-bucket/my-folder/my-sub-folder/my-file</code>.
   * <p>
   * Given an HCP connection, with a configured root folder path of <code>my-folder</code>, and a configured domain of
   * <code>my-domain.com:3000</code>,the <code>pvfs</code> URL,
   * <code>pvfs://my-hcp-connection/my-sub-folder/my-file</code>, would convert to the provider URL,
   * <code>hcp://my-domain.com:3000/my-folder/my-sub-folder/my-file</code>.
   *
   * @return A non-empty root path, if any; {@code null}, otherwise.
   *
   * @see ConnectionFileNameParser
   * @see VFSConnectionManagerHelper#getResolvedRootPath(VFSConnectionDetails)
